<h2>About</h2>
</div>

Fork of the original [Watch Dogs Vehicle Looting](https://github.com/CamK06/Watch-Dogs-Vehicle-Looting) mod  combined with the [Lore-Friendly Watch Dogs Vehicle Looting Item List](https://www.gta5-mods.com/misc/lore-friendly-watchdogs-vehicle-looting-item-list) mod by default with some of my own changes included.

<h2>Installing</h2>

<h2>Changes</h2>
</div>

Changes in my version compared to the one on [GTA5-Mods](https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/watch-dogs-vehicle-looting-net):
1. Chance of getting a wanted level when selling items (originally implemented as 1 in 2 chance but was never released on GTA5-Mods, now 1 in 5)
2. Item list replaced with Lore-Friendly Watch Dogs Vehicle Looting Item List lists
3. Items that can't be sold are no longer added to the player's inventory (stops unnecessary bloat of inventories.json)
4. Vehicle class block list so motorcycles and other vehicle classes can't be looted
	1. Includes an exception list for specific vehicle models
5. Food items now heal specific amounts according to configurable values in modConfig.json
6. Localization support for each supported language in GTA 5 (W.I.P as of 6th of November, 2023)
